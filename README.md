This repository showcases examples of uncommon or subtle bugs that can occur in Python code.  These examples are designed to help developers understand how to identify and avoid these issues in their own projects. The examples cover areas such as exception handling, incorrect return types, resource management and more. Each example provides both the buggy code and a corrected version, along with explanations. It's useful for intermediate to advanced Python developers looking to improve their code quality and error handling.
